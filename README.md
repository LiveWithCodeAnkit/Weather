# Weather App using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and API Fetching


Welcome to my Weather App project! This is a simple web application built using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and API fetching to provide users with real-time weather information and hourly temperature charts.

## Features

- Enter Location: Users can input a city name to fetch weather data for that location.
- Real-Time Weather Data: The app fetches real-time weather data from a weather API to provide accurate and up-to-date information.
- Hourly Temperature Chart: The app displays an hourly temperature chart using Recharts, giving users a visual representation of temperature changes throughout the day.

## Technologies Used

- React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that simplifies styling and makes your app responsive.
- API Fetching: The app uses API calls to fetch weather data from an external source.
- Recharts: A charting library for React.js that helps you create interactive and customizable charts.
